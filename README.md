Cyber Detection Rules

---


## 🧠 Detection Philosophy

- **Behavior over indicators**  
- **Threat-informed**, aligned with adversary TTPs  
- **Context-aware**, leveraging correlation and enrichment  
- **Defender-centric**, written for operational security teams  

Where applicable, detections include:
- MITRE ATT&CK mappings  
- Tuning guidance  
- Known evasion considerations  

---

## 🧪 Rule Quality Standards

Each detection rule should document:

- Detection purpose  
- Required data sources  
- Detection logic  
- Expected false positives and tuning notes  
- Suggested severity and confidence level  

---

## ⚙️ Supported Platforms & Formats

- **YARA / YARA-L / YARA-L 2.0**  
- **Sigma** (generic, SIEM-agnostic format)  
- **Splunk SPL**  
- **Elastic (KQL)**  
- **Microsoft Sentinel (KQL)**  
- **IBM QRadar (AQL)**  
- Network telemetry (DNS, proxy, NetFlow)

Sigma rules may be used as the **authoritative source**, with platform-specific rules derived from them where applicable.
